*Principles of the IPA* (IPA 1949):

- 20: [I]t is recommended that the nearest appropriate roman letter be substituted for it.

- 21: As sounds of the **ɒ** type have considerable acoustic similarity to those in the **ɔ** and **ɑ** areas, it is generally advisable to represent them by one of these more familiar symbols.

*Report on the 1989 Kiel Conventio* (IPA 1989)

> The relationship between vowels is described by plotting them on a quadrilateral, which represent an abstract, notional 'vowel space'. This vowel space has a correlation, though not an exact correspondence, with each of two aspects of the physical speech event of vowels: the position of the tongue; and the acoustic (and, relatedly, auditory) reflex of a vowel's production expressed as a plotting of its resonant frequences.

*The Handbook of the IPA* (IPA 1999):

> The use of auditory spacing in the definition of these vowels means vowel description is not based purely on articulation, and is one reason why the vowel quadrilateral must be regarded as an abstraction and not a direct mapping of tongue position.

Ladefoged's informal CV:

> Daniel Jones himself published photographs of only four of his own cardinal vowels, although, as he told me in 1955, he had photographs of all 8 vowels. When I asked him why he had not published the other four photographs, he smiled and said **"People would have found them too confusing."**

## Conclusions

---

- Reasons behind the IPA vowel quadrilateral shows that the initial articulatory + auditory criteria were abstracted over time.

- Articulatory space is much more complex than what the chart suggests.

- Acoustic space is not a trapezoid but a triangle.

- History of the IPA there were critics of the trapezoid.

- Lindsey's alternative vowel triangle is the best improvement we got so far.
